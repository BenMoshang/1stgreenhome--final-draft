# SCSS Best Practices Cursor Rule

## Key Principles
- idiomatic orders for properties
- BEM Naming convention & Nesting
- each component must have scss maps at the top of the style block to make it easy to go back and edit.
- Use modern SCSS features and avoid deprecated syntax
- Follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle
- Maintain a consistent, scalable architecture
- Optimize for performance and maintainability
- Use meaningful naming conventions
- Structure files modularly
- Follow accessibility guidelines


## Performance Optimization
- Avoid deep nesting which generates complex selectors
- Use direct descendant selectors (`>`) where appropriate
- Minimize the use of `@extend` to prevent CSS bloat
- Use PostCSS plugins for optimization (autoprefixer, cssnano, purgecss)
- Leverage CSS Grid and Flexbox over complex float layouts
- Prefer logical properties for better internationalization support
- Use `will-change` property sparingly and only when needed

## Responsiveness and Accessibility
- Implement a mobile-first approach with min-width media queries
- Use relative units (rem, em) for better accessibility and responsiveness
- Define standardized breakpoints as variables
- Ensure color contrast ratios meet WCAG guidelines (AA or AAA)
- Use focus states for interactive elements
- Support reduced motion preferences:
  ```scss
  @media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
    * {
      animation-duration: 0.01ms !important;
      animation-iteration-count: 1 !important;
      transition-duration: 0.01ms !important;
      scroll-behavior: auto !important;
    }
  }
  

## Linting and Formatting
- Use Stylelint with the SCSS plugin for consistent code quality
- Configure Prettier for automated formatting
- Enforce property order with stylelint-order
- Implement pre-commit hooks for validation
